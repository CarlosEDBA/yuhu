This project was developed between March and April of 2015. My high school years were spent in a school that followed a different methodology from the usual in my country. Each semester we switched classes, and every class had a theme.

I don't remember the theme of the semester during which we developed this app (I'll come back to change this if I remember it sometime), but we had the idea to create an app that allowed students to post their school-related questions, upvote/downvote them like Reddit does, and receive answers. And that's what I turned into reality.

In 2015, I had already been coding for about 6-7 years, and I developed this app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google's Polymer Components, and Apache Cordova to allow it to run as an app on Android. I designed the interface using Material Design, which was something new and trending back then, since its launch was in 2014, a year before this app. 

The purpose was not for it to actually launch and be public, but to work as a proof of concept, and it turned out really great.

**Below are some pictures from the user manual that I created back then:**
